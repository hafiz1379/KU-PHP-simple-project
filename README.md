## Getting Started

To set up and run this User Information Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Database Configuration**: Update the database connection details in the `db_connection.php` file to match your PostgreSQL database configuration. Replace the following variables with your own values:
   - `$host`: the database host (e.g., "localhost")
   - `$port`: the database port (e.g., "5432")
   - `$dbname`: the name of the database
   - `$user`: your PostgreSQL username
   - `$password`: your PostgreSQL password

2. **Database Setup**: Create a PostgreSQL database named `user_information` and a table named `users` with columns: `id`, `name`, `age`, and `phone_number`.

3. **Web Server**: You can run this system on a local web server like Apache or Nginx. Ensure that PHP is installed and configured on your server.

4. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hafiz1379/KU-PHP-simple-project
   ```

5. **Start the Web Server**: Start your web server and ensure that PHP is enabled.

6. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to the project directory, where you should see the main page `index.php`. You can start adding, updating, and deleting user information from this interface.

## Features

- **Add User**: You can add a new user by providing their name, age, and phone number.

- **View Users**: The system displays a list of all users with options to update or delete each user's information.

- **Update User**: You can edit user information, including name, age, and phone number.

- **Delete User**: Users can be removed from the database.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is as follows:

- `index.php`: The main page that displays the list of users and provides options to add, update, and delete user information.

- `user_form.html`: The form for adding a new user.

- `db_connection.php`: Contains the database connection settings.

- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web pages.

## Usage

1. Access the application through your web browser.
2. Use the "Add User" link to add new user information.
3. The "View Users" link will display a list of all users with options to update or delete each user's information.
